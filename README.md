Test Automation Best Practices

Maintainability:

**Use Page Object Model (POM):** 
Organize the code by pages where each page class contains methods representing the functionalities offered by the page. This reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.

**Externalize Test Data:** 
Keep test data like URLs, credentials, and expected values outside the test scripts in external files or configuration files. This makes it easier to update the data without touching the code.

Reusability:

**Modularize Your Code:**
Write reusable functions or methods for actions performed frequently, such as logging in or filling out forms.

**Utilize a Test Framework:**
Using a pytest test framework for Python can help in organizing your tests better and provides mechanisms for setup and teardown operations, which are reusable across tests.

Scalability:

**Implement Continuous Integration (CI):**
Integrate the test suite with a CI pipeline to automatically run tests against code changes. This ensures scalability as the project grows.

**Parallel Test Execution:**
Leverage capabilities of the framework and infrastructure to run tests in parallel. This can significantly reduce the feedback loop for test execution as we add more tests.
